                We&apos;re excited to welcome those of you traveling to the San
                Francisco Bay Area! You&apos;ll quickly find that there's so
                much to see and that we&apos;re really only scratching the
                surface here on this page.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are able, we recommend staying for a week, particularly
                for first-time visitors. February 14th-21st may best overlap
                with others traveling (we&apos;ll continue to update as others
                inform us of their traveling plans).
              </p>
              <p>
                We don&apos;t have a travel agent, so you&apos;ll need to book
                flights and accomodations directly. We hope this page can
                provide some guidance and ideas, but feel free to reach out to
                either of us if you have any additional questions. We recommend
                booking sooner rather than later, prices will especially shoot
                upwards in the three months leading up to the wedding.

                in the East Bay (cities like Oakland or Berkeley) near a BART
                station or in the peninsula (cities like San Bruno, Burlingame
                or San Mateo) near a Caltrain station can be good options and
                still provide easy access to San Francisco.

              <p>
                The wedding venue is on the border of Oakland &amp; Berkeley, so
                if you&apos;re only staying for a few days, the East Bay could
                be a great option. Another way to save a few bucks is to

                Some of you may prefer to rent a car while you&apos;re here, but
                who wants to park on those California hills? Fortunately, the
                city and surrounding area is very navigable by BMW:

                walking. Muni is the local transportation agency in San
                Francisco (including subways, street cars, and buses) for
                intra-city transit. BART is an inter-city heavy-rail transit
                system connecting San Francisco with the East Bay and South Bay.
                You can also take the

                If you do choose to rent a car, here are a few tips to keep in
                mind: When parking, bring your valuables with you and never
                leave anything visible in your car, especially in the city.
                Smash &amp; grabs are common, Katrina &amp; I have even
                witnessed them on multiple occasions. Don&apos;t rent a car with
                tinted windows, this makes a break-in even more tempting for
                thieves. Getting free parking in the city can be difficult, but
                the app
                <a href="https://www.spotangels.com/" target="_blank"
                  >SpotAngels</a
                >
                can be a useful tool!

                worth visiting. For Victorian houses, check out The Painted
                Ladies&mdash; a group of homes that were repainted charming
                shades of pastel in the 1960s. Do you think Art Deco
                architecture is the bee&apos;s knees? Take a stroll over the
                Golden Gate Bridge, like we did!

                Head over to Lombard Street at Hyde to see the "crookedest
                street in the world". Also consider visiting Coit Tower, built
                in 1933. At 210 feet, you'll have a fantastic view of the city.
                Rounding out our suggestions for landmarks is The Palace of Fine
                Arts. The Beaux Arts style structure was originally built in
                1915, but was demolished in the 1960s due to instability. It was
                rebuilt in the 60s and 70s.

                San Francisco is blessed with many easy and stunning trails.
                Land&apos;s End &amp; Lovers&apos; Lane are a few of our
                favourites, not to mention the extraordinary 55 acres of

                Where there are hills, there are views. Billy Goat Hill, Corona
                Heights Park, and Grandview Park all provide great views of the
                city. From Baker Beach you can see the Golden Gate Bridge. It
                may be windy, but you can&apos;t beat watching the sunset from
                the summit of Twin Peaks.

                  >Exploratorium</a
                >, a mad scientist&apos;s playground. On the east side of the

                  >SF Museum of Modern Art</a

                  >Walt Disney Family museum</a

                a 12 foot diameter model of Disneyland. The museum is
                surprisingly large, and has interesting exhibitions and

                Chinatown in San Francisco is worth a visit&mdash; it&apos;s the
                oldest Chinatown in North America. Dragon&apos;s Gate, a
                beautiful and ornate structure, greets you when you enter. Dim
                sum, bakeries, herbal medicine, souvenirs&mdash; it can all be
                found in the area. For some summery vibes, check out Sausalito
                or Santa Cruz! Sausalito is just a ferry ride away from SF, and
                you can experience kayaking, seafood eats, and novelty stores
                (think fudge or Christmas ornaments year round). Santa Cruz is
                further out (you&apos;ll need to rent a car), and definitely
                more thrill packed. There&apos;s a small theme park by the beach
                for you roller coaster fans, and a pretty sizable pier with lots
                of entertainment. If you&apos;re checking out the park be sure
                to go on a weekend, when rides are typically open. In February,
                it&apos;s best to confirm the amusement park schedule ahead of
                time. Wintertime in Lake Tahoe will be pretty familiar to our
                Canadian guests! Skiing, snowboarding, and other winter
                activities are popular in February.

                We promise, San Francisco is more than just the land of avocado
                toast. SF is a melting pot of cultures, and as a result,
                cuisines! Japantown is a 23 acre area in the center of the city,

                restaurant. They specialize in Japanese curry, and creative
                pasta dishes. As an ode to popular culture, they frequently play
                Japanese animation on their tv's. Japantown has great sushi
                options, but for our next favorite, go to Potrero Hill district.

                which creatively uses vegetables (like okra and beets!!) instead
