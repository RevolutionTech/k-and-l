                We&apos;re excited to welcome those of you traveling to the San
                Francisco Bay Area! You&apos;ll quickly find that there's so
                much to see and that we&apos;re really only scratching the
                surface here on this page.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are able, we recommend staying for a week, particularly
                for first-time visitors. February 14th-21st may best overlap
                with others traveling (we&apos;ll continue to update as others
                inform us of their traveling plans).
              </p>
              <p>
                We don&apos;t have a travel agent, so you&apos;ll need to book
                flights and accomodations directly. We hope this page can
                provide some guidance and ideas, but feel free to reach out to
                either of us if you have any additional questions. We recommend
                booking sooner rather than later, prices will especially shoot
                upwards in the three months leading up to the wedding.

                in the East Bay (cities like Oakland or Berkeley) near a BART
                station or in the peninsula (cities like San Bruno, Burlingame
                or San Mateo) near a Caltrain station can be good options and
                still provide easy access to San Francisco.

                The wedding venue is on the border of Oakland &amp; Berkeley, so
                if you&apos;re only staying for a few days, the East Bay could
                be a great option. Another way to save a few bucks is to

                Some of you may prefer to rent a car while you&apos;re here, but
                who wants to park on those California hills? Fortunately, the
                city and surrounding area is very navigable by BMW:
                <em>&ast;ahem&ast;</em> that is
                <a href="https://www.bart.gov/">BART</a>,
                <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/">Muni</a>, &amp; walking. Muni
                is the local transportation agency in San Francisco (including
                subways, street cars, and buses) for intra-city transit. BART is
                an inter-city heavy-rail transit system connecting San Francisco
                with the East Bay and South Bay. You can also take the
                <a href="https://www.caltrain.com/main.html">Caltrain</a>, which
                travels south from San Francisco down to San Jose. The bay area
                also has a

                If you do choose to rent a car, here are a few tips to keep in
                mind: When parking, bring your valuables with you and never
                leave anything visible in your car, especially in the city.
                Smash &amp; grabs are common, Katrina &amp; I have even
                witnessed them on multiple occasions. Don&apos;t rent a car with
                tinted windows, this makes a break-in even more tempting for
                thieves. Getting free parking in the city can be difficult, but
                the app <a href="https://www.spotangels.com/">SpotAngels</a> can
                be a useful tool!

              <p>
                One thing about your trip to San Francisco is for certain
                &mdash; you won&apos;t be bored. Hopefully this section can
                provide some inspiration of what to check out while you&apos;re
                here, but it certainly shouldn&apos;t be treated as an
                exhaustive list.

                If you&apos;re a fan of architecture, there are plenty of sites
                worth visiting. For Victorian houses, check out The Painted
                Ladies&mdash; a group of homes that were repainted charming
                shades of pastel in the 1960s. Do you think Art Deco
                architecture is the bee&apos;s knees? Take a stroll over the
                Golden Gate Bridge, like we did!

                Head over to Lombard Street at Hyde to see the "crookedest
                street in the world". Also consider visiting Coit Tower, built
                in 1933. At 210 feet, you'll have a fantastic view of the city.
                Rounding out our suggestions for landmarks is The Palace of Fine
                Arts. The Beaux Arts style structure was originally built in
                1915, but was demolished in the 1960s due to instability. It was
                rebuilt in the 60s and 70s.

                San Francisco is blessed with many easy and stunning trails.
                Land&apos;s End &amp; Lovers&apos; Lane are a few of our
                favourites, not to mention the extraordinary 55 acres of
                botanical gardens in Golden Gate Park. Here we are at Interior
                Greenbelt in the middle of the city.

                Where there are hills, there are views. Billy Goat Hill, Corona
                Heights Park, and Grandview Park all provide great views of the
                city. From Baker Beach you can see the Golden Gate Bridge. It
                may be windy, but you can&apos;t beat watching the sunset from
                the summit of Twin Peaks.

                Some would call it a tourist trap, but Pier 39 and the
                Fisherman&apos; Wharf neighbourhood of San Francisco have plenty
                of family-friendly activities to enjoy including a wax museum,
                arcades, and the Ghirardelli Marketplace.

                Stroll just a bit down the Embarcadero to find our first museum
                recommendation&mdash; the Exploratorium, a mad scientist&apos;s
                playground. On the east side of the city you&apos;ll find the SF
                Museum of Modern Art, one of the largest art museums in the US.
                If you&apos;re a Disney fan, be sure to check out the Walt
                Disney Family museum, which was founded by one of Disney&apos;s
                daughters, and has a 12 foot diameter model of Disneyland. The
                museum is surprisingly large, and has interesting exhibitions
                and screening events. Finally in Golden Gate Park you&apos;ll
                find the California Academy of Sciences, a museum of natural
                history with a funky green roof inspired by San Francisco hills.
                The museum features a planetarium, acquarium, and an indoor
                rainforest.

                While in Golden Gate Park, tour the Conservatory of Flowers and
                the Japanese Tea Garden. You can also swing by Stow Lake for a
                bit of row boating or pedal boating. For a blast to the past,
                check out the Haight Ashbury district. You&apos;ll be feeling
                groovy in no time, when you check out the vintage clothing
                stores and buy some vinyl over at Amoeba Records. The area is
                also home to a giant leg sculpture dangling out of a window,
                comfort foods like over at Hippie Thai, and its many smoke
                shops.

                Chinatown in San Francisco is worth a visit&mdash; it&apos;s the
                oldest Chinatown in North America. Dragon&apos;s Gate, a
                beautiful and ornate structure, greets you when you enter. Dim
                sum, bakeries, herbal medicine, souvenirs&mdash; it can all be
                found in the area. For some summery vibes, check out Sausalito
                or Santa Cruz! Sausalito is just a ferry ride away from SF, and
                you can experience kayaking, seafood eats, and novelty stores
                (think fudge or Christmas ornaments year round). Santa Cruz is
                further out (you&apos;ll need to rent a car), and definitely
                more thrill packed. There&apos;s a small theme park by the beach
                for you roller coaster fans, and a pretty sizable pier with lots
                of entertainment. If you&apos;re checking out the park be sure
                to go on a weekend, when rides are typically open. In February,
                it&apos;s best to confirm the amusement park schedule ahead of
                time. Wintertime in Lake Tahoe will be pretty familiar to our
                Canadian guests! Skiing, snowboarding, and other winter
                activities are popular in February.

                We promise, San Francisco is more than just the land of avocado
                toast. SF is a melting pot of cultures, and as a result,
                cuisines! Japantown is a 23 acre area in the center of the city,
                and the site of our first pick, On the Bridge restaurant. They
                specialize in Japanese curry, and creative pasta dishes. As an
                ode to popular culture, they frequently play Japanese animation
                on their tv's. Japantown has great sushi options, but for our
                next favorite, go to Potrero Hill district. At Live Sushi Bar,
                you'll have a contemporary and sleek setting for delicious and
                fresh dishes. Not a fan of fish? Try out Shizen, which
                creatively uses vegetables (like okra and beets!!) instead of
                fish. This vegan sushi restaurant is quintessential San
                Francisco.

                Another classic SF to-do is Mexican food. Mission district has a
                lot of amazing options, so we will leave you to discover these
                yourself! Also in the Mission district is Izakaya Goku, our
                favorite place to grab a bowl of ramen! Izakaya Goku is a small,
                laidback place to unwind with a beer and slurp up some noodles.
                If you're in a mood for European food, head over to Hayes
                Valley, for our next two picks. For French cuisine, try out Chez
                Maman, which has both classic (escargot!) and more
                "Americanized" choices to pick from. You can see what Katrina
                went ahead with&hellip; For German food, try Suppenk&uuml;che!
                We highly recommend the currywurst.

                Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum can be found in our first bar
                recommendation&mdash; Smuggler&apos;s Cove. This is the ideal
                place to sip on some grog and pretend to be a pirate. If
                you&apos;d rather not weigh anchor, and would rather have a pint
                of Anchor Steam, go to Anchor Brewing in the Potrero district.
                Anchor Brewing offers tours (and tasting is included, so
                don&apos;t arrive with an empty stomach!) Other great options
                for beer include Magnolia Brewing in the Haight, or Biergarten
                in Hayes Valley.

                If you&apos;re looking for an island getaway, Pagan Idol offers
                up an immersive tiki experience. For a film noir/speakeasy vibe,
                go to Wilson & Wilson, a secret bar within a bar. Be sure to
                make a reservation to get the password! When you&apos;ve solved
                the case, settle down with a book at Novela, a literary themed
                cocktail bar with drinks named after characters. If you feel
                like venturing outside of the city during your visit, stop by
                Napa, California&apos;s wine country.
